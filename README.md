## HTML Questions :

<br>

### 1) `<!DOCTYPE html>` is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?
<br>

##### Answer :
```
Yes, <!DOCTYPE html> is indeed a tag in HTML. However, it is not a regular HTML element like <div>
or <p>. Instead, it is called a document type declaration (DTD) and it is used to specify the version of
HTML or XHTML that the document is written in.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used at the very beginning of an HTML document to inform the
web browser about the version of HTML being used. In HTML5, <!DOCTYPE html> is the
recommended and simplest doctype declaration, indicating that the document is written in HTML5.
The purpose of the doctype declaration is to ensure that the web browser renders the document in
the correct way. Different versions of HTML have different rules and syntax, so specifying the
doctype helps the browser understand how to interpret and display the content of the document. It
also helps ensure backward compatibility with older browsers.
By using <!DOCTYPE html>, you are telling the browser to treat the document as an HTML5
document, which is the latest version of HTML and is widely supported by modern web browsers.
```

### 2) Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

<br>
##### Answer :

```
Semantic tags in HTML are a set of elements that provide meaning and structure to the content
within a web page. These tags describe the type of content they enclose, allowing search engines,
screen readers, and other web technologies to better understand and interpret the information.
Semantic tags help improve accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization (SEO) of
web pages.Overall, semantic tags enhance both the human and machine interpretation of web content,
resulting in improved accessibility, SEO, and code maintainability.


```

### 3) Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

<br>

##### Answer :

```
HTML Tags and Elements are closely related but have distinct meanings:
HTML Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML markup. They are used to define the structure and
elements of an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and appear as opening
and closing pairs. For example, <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag. Tags indicate the
beginning and end of an element and define its purpose and behavior.
HTML Elements: Elements are made up of tags and the content they enclose. An HTML element
consists of an opening tag, the content within the element, and a closing tag. The content can be
text, other nested elements, or both. For example, the element <p>Hello, World!</p> consists of the
opening tag <p>, the content "Hello, World!", and the closing tag </p>. The element represents a
paragraph in HTML.
In summary, tags are used to define the beginning and end of an element, while elements
encompass both the tags and the content they enclose. HTML tags are like containers, and HTML
elements are the actual content within those containers.

### 6) What are some of the advantages of HsTML5 over its previous versions?

<br>

##### Answer :
HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several advancements and
advantages over its previous versions. Here are some key advantages of HTML5:
Rich Multimedia Support: HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements,
eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This simplifies the integration and playback of
multimedia content, making it more accessible and efficient.
Canvas Element: HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, which allows for dynamic, scriptable
rendering of graphics and animations directly within the browser without the need for external
plugins. This provides greater flexibility and interactivity in creating visual elements on the web.
Improved Semantics: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <footer>,
and <article>, which provide a clearer structure to web content. These semantic elements enhance
accessibility, search engine optimization, and code readability by describing the purpose and
meaning of different sections within a webpage.
Enhanced Form Controls: HTML5 introduced new input types, such as date, time, email, URL, and
range, which provide improved user experience and better input validation. Additionally, HTML5
introduced form validation APIs, enabling client-side validation without the need for JavaScript.
Offline and Storage Capabilities: HTML5 introduced features like the Application Cache and Local
Storage, enabling web applications to work offline and store data locally. This allows users to
continue using web apps even when they are not connected to the internet and provides a smoother
user experience.
Improved Performance: HTML5 incorporates optimizations and improvements to enhance the
overall performance of web pages. It includes features like async and defer attributes for script
loading, which improve page loading times, and optimized rendering algorithms that enhance the
speed and efficiency of web browsers.
Mobile-Friendly and Responsive Design: HTML5 offers better support for mobile devices and
responsive design. It includes features like media queries for detecting device characteristics and the
<meta> viewport tag for controlling the layout and scaling of web content on different screen sizes.
Backward Compatibility: HTML5 was designed with backward compatibility in mind. Older HTML
markup will continue to work in HTML5, ensuring that existing web pages and applications built with
previous versions can still be utilized without major modifications.
These are some of the key advantages that HTML5 brings over its previous versions. Its features and
improvements contribute to better multimedia support, enhanced semantics, improved form
controls, offline capabilities, performance optimizations, mobile-friendliness, and backward
compatibility.

### 8) What is the difference between `<figure>` tag and `<img>` tag?

<br>

#### Answer :
  The <figure> tag and the <img> tag serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:
<img> tag: The <img> tag is used to embed an image within an HTML document. It is a self-closing
tag and does not have any content. It requires the src attribute to specify the path or URL of the
image file and typically includes the alt attribute for providing alternative text that describes the
image. The <img> tag is primarily used to display a standalone image on a web page.
  
```

<br>

### 9) Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

<br>

#### Answer :

```
The HTML tag and attribute are two different concepts within HTML:
HTML Tag: An HTML tag represents an element in an HTML document. It defines the structure and
functionality of the content within the document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and can
be either opening tags, self-closing tags, or closing tags. Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>,
<h1>, <img>, etc. HTML tags define the elements that make up the structure of a webpage.
HTML Attribute: An HTML attribute provides additional information about an HTML element.
Attributes are added within the opening tag of an HTML element to modify its behavior or provide
extra details. They are composed of a name-value pair. The attribute name specifies the property or
characteristic, while the attribute value provides the corresponding value for that property.
Attributes can be applied to various HTML elements to customize their behavior and appearance.
Examples of HTML attributes include src, alt, href, class, id, style, etc.
Here are some examples of global attributes, which can be applied to most HTML elements:
class: Specifies one or more class names to associate with an element, allowing CSS and JavaScript to
target and style the element.
Example: <div class="container">
id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, which can be used to target the element with CSS or
JavaScript.
Example: <p id="my-paragraph">
style: Defines inline CSS styles to apply to an element.
Example: <h1 style="color: red;">Heading</h1>
title: Provides additional information about an element when hovering over it.
Example: <a href="#" title="Click here">Link</a>
data-*: Allows custom data attributes to be added to elements, which can be accessed via JavaScript
for various purposes.
Example: <div data-custom-attribute="value">
aria-*: Used to define accessibility-related attributes, providing additional information to assistive
technologies and screen readers.
Example: <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
These global attributes can be applied to various HTML elements to customize their behavior,
appearance, or accessibility features. It's important to note that some attributes are specific to
certain elements, while global attributes can be used across different elements.

## CSS Questions :

<br>

### 1) Whats Box Model in CSS & Which CSS Properties are part of it ?

<br>

#### Answer :

```
  The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that describes how
elements are rendered and how their dimensions and spacing are calculated. It consists of several
properties that define the content area, padding, border, and margin of an element.
The CSS properties that are part of the box model are:
Content: The actual content of an element, such as text or an image. The content area is controlled
by the width and height properties.
Padding: The space between the content area and the element's border. Padding can be set using
the padding property or individual properties like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and
padding-left.
Border: The border surrounding the element's content and padding. The border can be set using the
border property or individual properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.
Margin: The space outside the element, creating the gap between adjacent elements. Margin can be
set using the margin property or individual properties like margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom,
and margin-left.

  ```

### 2) What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?

<br>

#### Answer :

```
  There are many selectors are present in css. first one is Element Selectors, it's Select elements based on their HTML tag name. Class Selectors, it's Select elements based on their assigned class attribute. ID Selectors, it's Select a specific element based on its assigned ID attribute. Attribute Selectors, it's Select elements based on their attribute values. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Select elements based on specific states or conditions or target specific parts of an element.
```

<br>

### 3) What is VW/VH & How its different from PX?

<br>

#### Answer :

```
  VW (Viewport Width) and VH (Viewport Height) are CSS units that are relative to the size of the
viewport, which is the visible portion of the browser window.
VW (Viewport Width): The VW unit represents a percentage of the viewport's width. 1 VW is equal
to 1% of the viewport width. For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, 1 VW is equivalent to
10 pixels.
VH (Viewport Height): The VH unit represents a percentage of the viewport's height. 1 VH is equal to
1% of the viewport height. For example, if the viewport height is 800 pixels, 1 VH is equivalent to 8
pixels.
The key difference between VW/VH and PX (pixels) is that VW and VH are relative units that scale
based on the size of the viewport, while pixels (PX) are absolute units that represent a fixed size.
Using VW and VH units can be beneficial in creating responsive and fluid layouts that adapt to
different screen sizes. For example, you can set an element's width to 50 VW, and it will always
occupy 50% of the viewport width regardless of the device or screen size.
On the other hand, pixels (PX) are fixed units that maintain a consistent size regardless of the
viewport. If you set an element's width to 200 pixels, it will always have a width of 200 pixels,
regardless of the viewport size.
VW and VH units are particularly useful for creating responsive designs that adjust dynamically
based on the available screen space. They provide a way to size elements proportionally to the
viewport, allowing for better flexibility and adaptability in different viewing environments.

### 4) Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

<br>

#### Answer :

```
  The differences between inline, inline-block, and block display properties in CSS relate to how
elements are rendered and how they interact with other elements on the page:
Inline: Elements displayed as inline do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as
necessary to contain their content. They flow alongside each other horizontally, and their height and
width are determined by their content. Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, <strong>,
<em>, etc.
Inline-block: Elements displayed as inline-block have characteristics of both inline and block
elements. They flow alongside each other horizontally like inline elements, but they also respect
width, height, padding, and margins like block elements. This means you can set width and height
values, apply margins and padding, and have them affect the layout without forcing a line break.
Examples of inline-block elements are <img>, <input>, and elements styled with display: inline-block.
Block: Elements displayed as block start on a new line and take up the entire width available by
default. They create a block-level box, which means they have line breaks before and after them,
and can have margins, padding, and width/height set. Examples of block elements are <div>, <p>,
<h1> to <h6>, <section>, etc.
  ```

<br>

### 5)How is Border-box different from Content Box?
  <br>

#### Answer :

```
  The difference between border-box and content-box is related to how the width and height of an
element are calculated and how the box model properties (content, padding, border, and margin)
affect the overall size of the element.
Content-box: The content-box is the default box-sizing property value. With content-box, the width
and height of an element only include the content area. In other words, any padding, border, or
margin applied to the element is added to the specified width and height. This means that the total
size of the element will be the sum of its content width/height, padding width/height, and border
width/height.
```

### 6) Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ?

<br>

#### Answer :

```
  z-index is a CSS property that controls the stacking order of positioned elements on the z-axis
(depth) of a web page. It specifies the order in which elements are stacked or layered in relation to
each other. Elements with a higher z-index value will appear in front of elements with a lower value.
Here's how z-index functions:
Default Stacking Order: By default, elements have a z-index value of auto. Elements are rendered in
the order they appear in the HTML markup, with later elements appearing on top of earlier ones.
Positioned Elements: The z-index property only applies to positioned elements, i.e., elements with a
CSS position value of relative, absolute, or fixed. It does not have any effect on non-positioned
elements.
Stacking Context: Each positioned element creates a stacking context. The z-index property applies
within the stacking context of an element. An element with a higher z-index value within its stacking
context will appear in front of elements with lower values.
Higher Values = Closer to the Viewer: The stacking order is determined by the numeric z-index value.
The element with the highest z-index appears in front of other elements within the same stacking
context. Negative values can also be used to position elements behind others.
Parent-Child Relationship: When elements are nested, the z-index property of child elements is
relative to the stacking context of their parent. If a parent element has a higher z-index value than its
child, the child element cannot appear in front of the parent.
It's important to note that z-index only affects elements within the same stacking context. If two
elements are in different stacking contexts, their z-index values do not directly compare to each
other.
Using z-index, you can control the visual layering and stacking order of elements on a web page. It
allows you to position elements in front of or behind other elements, creating depth and visual
hierarchy in your design.

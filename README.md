## HTML Questions :

<br>

### 1) `<!DOCTYPE html>` is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?
<br>

##### Answer :
```
Yes, <!DOCTYPE html> is indeed a tag in HTML. However, it is not a regular HTML element like <div>
or <p>. Instead, it is called a document type declaration (DTD) and it is used to specify the version of
HTML or XHTML that the document is written in.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used at the very beginning of an HTML document to inform the
web browser about the version of HTML being used. In HTML5, <!DOCTYPE html> is the
recommended and simplest doctype declaration, indicating that the document is written in HTML5.
The purpose of the doctype declaration is to ensure that the web browser renders the document in
the correct way. Different versions of HTML have different rules and syntax, so specifying the
doctype helps the browser understand how to interpret and display the content of the document. It
also helps ensure backward compatibility with older browsers.
By using <!DOCTYPE html>, you are telling the browser to treat the document as an HTML5
document, which is the latest version of HTML and is widely supported by modern web browsers.

### 2) Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

<br>
##### Answer :

```
Semantic tags in HTML are a set of elements that provide meaning and structure to the content
within a web page. These tags describe the type of content they enclose, allowing search engines,
screen readers, and other web technologies to better understand and interpret the information.
Semantic tags help improve accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization (SEO) of
web pages.Overall, semantic tags enhance both the human and machine interpretation of web content,
resulting in improved accessibility, SEO, and code maintainability.

### 3) Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

<br>

##### Answer :

```
HTML Tags and Elements are closely related but have distinct meanings:
HTML Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML markup. They are used to define the structure and
elements of an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and appear as opening
and closing pairs. For example, <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag. Tags indicate the
beginning and end of an element and define its purpose and behavior.
HTML Elements: Elements are made up of tags and the content they enclose. An HTML element
consists of an opening tag, the content within the element, and a closing tag. The content can be
text, other nested elements, or both. For example, the element <p>Hello, World!</p> consists of the
opening tag <p>, the content "Hello, World!", and the closing tag </p>. The element represents a
paragraph in HTML.
In summary, tags are used to define the beginning and end of an element, while elements
encompass both the tags and the content they enclose. HTML tags are like containers, and HTML
elements are the actual content within those containers.
